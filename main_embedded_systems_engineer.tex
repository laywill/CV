% This template uses several fonts not included with Windows/Linux by

% TODO:
% 1. Integrate bibtex for article citation under publications.
% 2. Figure out a smoother way for the document to flow onto the next page.
% 3. Add styling information for a "Projects/Hacks" section.
% 4. Add location/address information
% 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Known Issues:

I am seeking an embedded systems role within a multi-disciplinary project.
I enjoy working in a highly collaborative environment on challenging technical problems, ranging from concept generation to design, manufacture and product support.
I like doing `a bit of everything' on a project \textemdash putting into use practical skills and resourcefulness honed during my time working in live events.
I enjoy everything from prototyping and debugging lab work, to creating test platforms and one-off electronic circuitry, to coding, documentation and customer presentations.
\newline
In summary: A jack of all trades, master of some!
