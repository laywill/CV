I am seeking a role within a company that recognises the value that its people bring to the business.
I enjoy working in a highly collaborative environment in which people f eel empowered and engaged in their day-to-day work and their overall career progression.
% Everyone is different and has different needs - I believe that recognising this fact helps to build happier, and more productive teams.
Working as an Engineer across a variety of fields I have gained a cross-cutting knowledge base that facilitates better understanding of others' skills, and how to match the interests of the individual with the needs of the business.
I am a people orientated generalist and thrive when my work is varied, challenging, and meaningful.
\newline
In summary: A jack of all trades, master of some!
