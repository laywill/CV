I attempt the \href{https://adventofcode.com/}{Advent of Code} programming puzzles every December - you can see my attempts in \href{https://gitlab.com/laywill/}{GitLab}.
I apply DevOps best practice to experiment with new tools. This includes: CI pipeline, pre-commit beautification and static analysis.
