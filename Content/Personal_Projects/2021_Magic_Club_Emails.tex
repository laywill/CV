I was approached by a member of the Cambridge Pentacle Club to assist in the design and implementation of a system to send customised email notifications to Club members of upcoming events.
The solution I designed, proposed, and helped to implement uses Python scripts to gather Google calendar data and securely send an email using a Google API.
This service is run by a scheduled \href{https://gitlab.com/}{GitLab.com} CI Pipeline, and continues to be used by the club.
