I was approached to assist in the design and implementation of a system to send customised email notifications of upcoming events to Club members.
My solution uses Python scripts to gather Google calendar data and securely send an email using a Google API.
This service is run by a scheduled \href{https://gitlab.com/}{GitLab.com} CI Pipeline, and continues to be used by the club.
