I took my existing CV written in \LaTeX, broke it down into sections that can be quickly combined to target different roles.
I use \href{https://www.overleaf.com}{OverLeaf} and a \href{https://www.github.com/laywill/CV}{GitHub repo} to quickly tailor CVs, generate the output products and provide version control.
