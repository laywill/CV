Backstage Technical Services is a Student Union (SU) society at the University of Bath, providing technical expertise for theatre and live events to SU groups, the University and external clients.

    \item As a Member I was a design authority as a Department Head. I was Technical Manager for the largest live events on the calendar, and for numerous theatre events, leading teams of up to 40 volunteers at a time. 
    
    \item As Production Manager (2012-13) I handled all initial client contact, and managed bookings throughout the year.
    
    \item As Chair of the society (2016-17) I lead the interaction of the society with the Students' Union staff and with University stakeholders. Additionally I was responsible for conflict resolution and chairing meetings.
    
    \item I still return to Bath occasionally as an Associate Member to lead training sessions, passing on knowledge and industy experience to current members.
