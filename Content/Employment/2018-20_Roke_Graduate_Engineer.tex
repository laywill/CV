% \vspace{0.5em}
In Dec 2018 I joined a flagship project: designing and delivering a miniaturised software defined radio.
% \vspace{0.25em}
\begin{tightemize}
  \item Design Lead for multiple FPGA firmware modules: design, implementation, testing, and writing driver software
  \item Prototyped, debugged and implemented SPI and I2C interfaces.
  \item Designed and made cables and circuitry to connect test equipment.
  \item Designed in CAD, organised fabrication, and assembled 8 "Test Jigs" to facilitate software and firmware release testing on target hardware.
  Identified hardware configuration and modifications required.
  % \item Contributed to design decisions of chosen protocol for peripheral connections (e.g. SPI vs I2C vs SMBus vs CAN bus).
  \item Supporting tasks: requirements decomposition; technology evaluations; unit and system integration testing.
  \item Solo, and second author of multiple technical white-papers delivered to the customer.
\end{tightemize}

Outside of my project I was heavily involved across the business, for example:
