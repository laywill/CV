% While at University I was fortunate to be able to put down the deposit for a house.
% To cover the mortgage and running costs I needed to rent out rooms.
I purchased a house in severe dis-repair and project managed it's refurbishment: in only 63 days I had it "move in ready" for 5 tenants. I continued to run the house as a HMO after finishing university.
